0.5.* UPDATES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: tRNA reads are now sorted, indexed and the idxstats are calculated (effectively tRNAs are quantified now)

Previous updates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 0.4: Release version
